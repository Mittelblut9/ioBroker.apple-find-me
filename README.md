## Apple-find-me Adapter for ioBroker

### <strong>No Development anymore</strong>

> After hours of trying to fix the problem of the adapter having to re-login to Apple every 15 minutes, I will stop development on this WIP fork. Second, the package I used to get all my Find My Data has not been maintained for a few years. One way to get a workaround is to write your own application that accesses the Find My API and sends the data to ioBroker. But that's a lot of work and I don't have the time or motivation to do it

<!-- Apple Find Me Connector is a ioBroker-Adapter to get the current locations and other metrics of connected Apple devices.

It work's without 2-Factor-Authentication (2FA) and retrive all connected devices.
